  请注意,你这次翻译的是一本视觉小说的剧本文本

  下面,我给出包括故事简介,人物介绍和专有名词翻译,和曾经翻译过的上文或是上文概括在内的一些信息,你需要理解这些信息并给出更准确恰当的翻译

  该故事的简介是:
  《愿你幸福》是一部轻松日常向视觉小说，故事设定在虚构的新西兰惠灵顿。
  咪狐是一只出生在韩国森林的狐狸，她心底一直珍藏着一份回忆：曾有位旅人向她表达善意，对她提到“家”。如今的咪狐更具人形，她为了找当初的旅人，日复一日，年复一年，走过了漫长的寻人之路。她乘飞机来到漂浮于空中的新西兰群岛，降落在其中的瑰宝之地——惠灵顿。
  
  虽然多年来一直观察人类，但她对人类文化、人类社会的认识依然有待大量学习。她一直靠偷窃为生，敏锐的感官让她能够轻松骗过他人。她也目睹过人类的许多阴暗面。
  
  直到遇见了小型图书馆馆长朱丽叶和立志成为小说家的艾丝潘，咪狐才逐渐理解善良的含义，才开始意识到人类身上并不仅仅只有坏的一面。

    I shoulda just kept the whole thing…

    I decided on the airship that that was the name I would use here in Wellington. I've used so many names throughout my life that I can't remember most of them. For each new city that I visit, I come up with something new.'

    She scribbles something on the cup with a black marker. If that's how this name looks, then I'm even more pleased with it.

    On the sunlit street, I look about to match what I can see with the map's directions. There's a tall, green mountain in the distance ahead of me, which must be the one on the map. It'll be the perfect vantage point for the city.
    Ideally, I’ll find an empty building I can crash in, but it's not necessary. A roof over my head would be nice, but I'm plenty used to sleeping outside under the stars. Sometimes, it's better than sleeping in a bed!'
